All functions in this contract are public, considering that the validity of the events can always be checked since they include the caller address.

#### `proclaimRedeem(address owner, uint256 amount)`

Emits the "Redeem" event containing the caller address, and the parameterized owner address and amount.

_Parameters:_
- `owner`: Address of the owner of pool tokens (should be a StrategyWallet contract).
- `receiver`: Address of the owner of pool tokens (should be the backer registered in the StrategyWallet).
- `amount`: Amount of pool tokens redeemed.

_Description:_
Is called by every StrategyPool contract in every `redeem` call. This function emits the `Redeem` event, which can be listened to off-chain.

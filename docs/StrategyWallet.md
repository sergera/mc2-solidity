# Strategy Wallet Contract Documentation

The MCÂ²Fi `StrategyWallet` contract holds backer's Pool tokens for all backed `StrategyPool`s.

It holds the address for a Backer account, and optionally, an Admin account, that can call certain functions in the Backer's name.

Both are parameterized in the constructor (`address(0)` for no Admin), and after contract creation the backer can:
- redeem Pool tokens from a `StrategyPool`
- revoke the Admin account
- change the Backer account

, and the Admin can:
- redeem Pool tokens from a `StrategyPool`
- revoke the Admin account
- change the Admin account

## Backer Only Functions
Functions that can only be called by the contract's backer (parameterized in the constructor), this contract only has one, which is responsible for changing the Backer account itself.
